Description:
For implementing reset password, I use redis as a broker,
celery as multiprocessing(for sending email).

Working process:
When the client clicks on url (تغییر رمز عبور) on navbar(profile icon dropdown),
a mail will be sent to his email address. The email contains
a url that includes a jwt token. When the client clicks the url,
a new page will be opened and if the token is valid, a form will be
shown to change password, otherwise it shows an error.

Note:
The reset password process can be used when the client is logged in.

Implementation process:
I have experienced to implement this task from the course
(django advance ali-bigdeli), although I use celery and redis documentaion,
and chat-gpt to implement the task.
