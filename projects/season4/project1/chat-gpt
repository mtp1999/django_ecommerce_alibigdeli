prompt1:
I wanna make a reset password page for users in my django app, in which when the user requests to reset,
an email send to him, the email has a url(and the url contains a jwt token based on user's info) when the user click on it,
it directs him to a page for reseting password

Note:
It starts with that prompt and then some of the output parts
changed manually.
